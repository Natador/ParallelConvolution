# Parallel 2D Discrete Convolution

Implement a parallelized [2D discrete convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_discrete_convolution) algorithm on a parallel multi-computer supporting [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/). Originally designed to be run on the [Big Red II Supercomputer](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bcqt).
